#Test Case Checker - CMPSC470: SemanticChecker
Checks your program's output against the given test outputs
##Set up
You probably will need to run chmod +x on it...</br>
Place it in the folder containing the .java / .y / .flex files </br>
I have paths hardcoded, but if you just extracted the .zip we were given you should be fine </br>
##Usage
Just run it with "./checker" and let it do its thing </br>
it will output "GOOD!" if you pass that test case, otherwise it will print in the following form </br>
ERROR ON FILE </br>
[minc file name] </br>
EXPECT... </br>
[expected output] </br>
RECIEVED... </br>
[what your program outputted] </br>
##Note
If any future semester people find this it should be fine to use contact me some how some way and I can update it if need be
